# Bowler - A GO build tool

## Installation

Just type the following command into your shell and make sure your **$GOPATH/bin** directory is included in **$PATH**:

	go get -u github.com/faryon93/bowler/...


## Bowlerfile

All options for building your project are set in the **Bowlerfile**. It should be located in the project root.
See example Bowlerfile:

	{
		"project": {
			"name": "PGProxy",
			"description": "A simple transparent PGP encryption proxy",
			"package": "git.1vh.de/maximilian.pachl/pgpproxy"
		},

		"go": {
			"min-version": "1.4.2"
		},

		"assets": [ "assets/" ]
	}

The *project* and *go* section is obligatory, while the *assets* section can be skipped.


## Assets
Bowler uses go-bindata to build your assets. See [https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata] for further information. 

**IMPORTANT: Bowler creates a file called assets__.go in your project root, so make sure your project does not include such file.**


## Usage

To build your project you can use the *build* command:

	$: bowler build

Cleaning up a project is as easy as typing:

	$: bowler clean

To create a new project you can use the *init* command. Bowler will ask you a few questions to create your Bowlerfile:

	$: bowler init
	Executing task 'init':
		project name: test
		project description: A super awesome project
		base package: github.com/tester/test          
		required GO version: 
	Successfully created Bowlerfile: /home/maxi/go/test/Bowlerfile

	Execution finished in 18.582381152s


## Tips

Your .gitignore file should exclude the **.bowler/** and **bin/** directory plus the **assets__.go** file from commits. Theses files are all artifacts which can easily generated by using the *build* command.
